# ü©∫  Healthcare System

This project is a voice- and vision-enabled healthcare assistant.  
It listens to a patient‚Äôs symptoms, looks at uploaded images (like a skin rash), and replies with a short, doctor-style opinion‚Äîboth in text **and** a natural-sounding voice.

The goal isn‚Äôt to replace a real doctor, but to give people **quick, accessible first-step insights** before they seek professional care.

---

## ‚ú® What It Can Do
- **Talk to You** ‚Äì Speak your symptoms and the system converts your voice to text using **Whisper Large-v3** (via Groq API).
- **See the Problem** ‚Äì Upload a photo of a visible condition (skin, eye, etc.) and a **Meta-LLaMA multimodal model** analyzes it.
- **Respond Like a Doctor** ‚Äì Receives the AI‚Äôs medical opinion in both written form and lifelike audio using **gTTS** or **ElevenLabs**.
- **Simple Web UI** ‚Äì Built with **Gradio**, so you can interact directly from your browser.
